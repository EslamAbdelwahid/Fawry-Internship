# JPA-Hibernate Practice

> [!NOTE]
> - The `prepare.sql` file ensures that the user and the database exist without creating the actual tables or relations.
>
> - In Hibernate, there is a property called `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` that enables automatic creation of database tables and their relations, eliminating the need to create them manually.
>
> - I have used a utility class to generate random data and insert it into the database tables. Therefore, the names and numbers are all randomly generated and have no specific meaning. This is done for testing purposes to ensure everything work properly.
