# Fawry Internship

- This repo contains the resources, tasks and projects that I have done during my internship at [**Fawry**](https://www.fawry.com/).

> [!Note]
> - For most of the tasks you will find `run.sh` script that will show the output of running the task.
> - I believe that sharing resources would be better than just explaining what I study.
> - In some topics, I may add some notes and explanations to make it easier to understand, or may not :)
> - You may find some resources that explain the same topic, but in different ways, or even explain advanced ones that you may not need for now.
>   - It is your job to filter them based on your needs. 
>   - Send a message if you need my help <3
