## Tasks

1. Initialize a new local repo, add some files to the project working directory then commit them to the repo and also make some changes on the files and commit them again. Finally print the commits history.

2. Create an annotated tag, and get its commit ref.

3. Checkout the HEAD to the previous commit, check the file then checkout the HEAD to the most recent commit again.

4. Revert to a specific commit in history and notice the changes on the repo files.

5. Create a new repo on GitLab and clone it locally.

6. Create a new branch of development, commit changes to the code in this branch, compare the status with the main/master branch. Then merge the development branch into main/master one.
